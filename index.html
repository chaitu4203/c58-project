                My hobby is reading. Most of the time I read fiction. I like reading goose bumps books. I read some of the books called "Lizard of OZ","The Haunted car","The Scary Teacher".
                These books are written by R.L.Stine
                he wrote so many books and goose bumps is my favorite fiction books.
